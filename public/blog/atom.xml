    &lt;h1 style=&quot;font-weight:700&quot;&gt;10 Ways to Lower Your Hospital Bills&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;A Guide by the Patient Advocates at Vera Health&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Stuck with a hospital bill that&#39;s way more than you expected? You&#39;re not alone. Over 56 million Americans under 65 had trouble paying medical bills in 2013, and most of those individuals had insurance. In fact, medical expenses account for 62% of bankruptcies in the US according to a 2007 Harvard University study. So when you get taken by surprise with a four-, five-, or even six-figure bill, what do you do?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We asked some of our most experienced patient advocates on the top 10 ways you can fight back:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;1. Offer to Pay in Full&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hospitals and doctors often provide uncompensated care because many patients don&#39;t have insurance and can&#39;t pay their bills. So those who can pay end up getting charged more. If you don&#39;t have insurance (or if you have a high deductible you still need to pay down), offering to pay the doctor upfront removes this uncertainty -- and your doctor might be willing to reduce your bill as a reward. Ask whether you can pay the Medicare rate; Medicare is able to negotiate lower prices with health care providers. Or you could simply start by offering to pay what you can afford. If you can&#39;t afford to pay much up front, you could offer to pay a portion of the bill right away followed by monthly installments. Discounts for paying up front can be substantial.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;2. Learn the Actual Cost of Procedures&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Arming yourself with price range information will give you a reasonable number to use when starting a discussion. Check your insurance carrier’s Web site. Most major carriers let members see their negotiated rates. Sites such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://healthcarebluebook.com/&quot;&gt;Healthcare Blue Book&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vimo.com/&quot;&gt;Vimo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newchoicehealth.com/&quot;&gt;New Choice Health&lt;/a&gt; also make it much easier to sleuth out these figures than in the past. With a few mouse clicks, you can get an idea of how much local hospitals and doctors charge, plus how large a discount the average insurer would receive.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;3. Vigilantly Review the Bills&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It’s very common for hospital bills to contain errors and overcharges, so make sure you’ve actually received the services they said you did. If you’re discharged in the morning (as most patients are), protest if you’re socked with a full daily-room rate for the date you left the hospital. And if you brought your medications with you, make sure you weren’t charged for them by the hospital. Also, dispute any additional fees on the bill for routine supplies, like gowns, gloves or sheets. These items should be factored into the hospital daily-room charge, because they are considered the cost of doing business.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;4. Ask for Discounts the Right Way&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once you have pricing reference points, but before you’ve committed to the procedure, visit the billing person in the doctor’s office or the manager of patient accounts at the hospital. This way, you can attempt to negotiate a discount before receiving treatment. Then, be clear and confident. Say something like, “These bills are extremely expensive. Would you consider adjusting the price to be more affordable?” Or “My insurance isn’t covering this treatment, so I’m paying for my own care and would like to see if you can lower the price.” Making things personal may help. If you’ve chosen a particular doctor because you’ve heard glowing recommendations from friends, mention that. If you’ve recently been laid off, say so. The billing staff may be willing to cut you a break.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;5. Offer to Pay in Cash&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Forgo the credit card if you think you might be asking for a discount later. Using plastic puts you in a weaker bargaining position with the hospital. “We recommend against credit cards, because the hospital loses any interest in negotiating with you” once they have your money, says Carol Pryor, policy director at The Access Project. And your bills could be even higher if you end up paying interest on the charges.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;6. Ask About a Payment Plan&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you are still facing a huge bill after negotiating a discount, ask for an interest-free payment plan. This strategy leaves you with the option to renegotiate the amount down the road, after demonstrating good faith by making timely payments. You can then write to the billing office: “I’ve been faithfully paying this bill for a year and half.” Remind the office of the total you’ve paid to date, and say something like, “My family is having a tough time during this economic crisis. Will you forgive the rest of the bill?”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;7. See if You Qualify For Hospital Financial Assistance.&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You may be required to go through the rigmarole of applying for Medicaid and being rejected before the facility will provide its assistance, though.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;8. Keep Great Records of Your Medical Treatment&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In addition to keeping your own medical records, you should take note of everything that happens after your treatment. This means keeping your bills and insurance paperwork organized, as well as tracking your phone calls with billing staff. This goes for medical billing staff and health insurance customer service staff as well – all should be able to provide a reference number for the call. Keep those reference numbers handy so you can follow up in two to three weeks, which is the time frame, Morgan advises. The most important part of good record keeping, however, is getting the right bill in your hands in the first place. Always call the billing department to get an itemized statement. Even though you’re entitled to a statement with every single charge on it, you’ll probably have to request it specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;9. Scrutinize Your Bills to Find Errors &lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Identifying medical bill errors could save you a significant amount of money. Start by looking for these common but costly errors:&lt;p&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;- Check your dates of service.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;- Look for duplicate charges.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;- Make sure you aren’t charged for canceled appointments and procedures.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;- Ensure your insurance information is accurate.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;- If any charges seem far too high, investigate further.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Other medical billing errors are difficult to spot. Practices like upcoding, where a patient is charged for a more serious (and expensive) procedure or diagnosis, or unbundling, where procedures that should have been billed together under a single code are billed separately leading to higher charges, may not be immediately apparent to the untrained eye but could be detected by a medical bill advocate.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;10. Get A Professional Advocate to Fight For You&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Medical bill advocates are professionals who work to save patients money. They audit bills for errors, communicate directly with medical providers and insurance companies about costs and coverage denials and negotiate to lower bills overall. You can handle some of the medical bill negotiating process yourself, but there are certain situations where you definitely need a medical bill advocate. If you’ve tried negotiating with your doctor or insurance company and gotten nowhere, if you don’t understand your bills and the charges on them or if you are considering filing bankruptcy due to medical debt, an advocate could help.&lt;/p&gt;
